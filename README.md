# STORM BOT

The StormBot is a bot finalized to flood messages in a specified Telegram Group with different VoIPs to avoid getting muted.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the following packages.

```bash
pip install pyrogram, pyromod, tgcrypto
```
The packages are needed to make the bot work properly.
TgCrypto is "optional", however it would make the bot signficantly faster.

Change the following settings:
```python
API_HASH = "0" # YOUR API_HASH
API_ID = 0 # YOUR API_ID
TOKEN = "0" # YOUR BOT_TOKEN
```
Into your API keys, if you don't have API keys you can create an App to generate them [here](https://my.telegram.org/apps).
